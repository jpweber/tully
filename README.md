# TULLY keymaster for docker and vault
## Description  
Helper service to safely distribute tokens from vault to docker containers.  Built on the concepts detailed by [VAULT cubbyhole principles](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault-cubbyhole-principles.html)

This is still an early pre-release project. I would not recommend using it just yet.
